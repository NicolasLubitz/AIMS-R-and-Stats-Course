# Scenario

An ecologist studying a rocky shore at Phillip Island, in southeastern Australia, was interested in how
clumps of intertidal mussels are maintained [@Quinn-1988-137]. In particular, he wanted to know how densities of adult
mussels affected recruitment of young individuals from the plankton. As with most marine invertebrates,
recruitment is highly patchy in time, so he expected to find seasonal variation, and the interaction
between season and density - whether effects of adult mussel density vary across seasons - was the aspect
of most interest.

The data were collected from four seasons, and with two densities of adult mussels. The experiment
consisted of clumps of adult mussels attached to the rocks. These clumps were then brought back to the
laboratory, and the number of baby mussels recorded. There were 3-6 replicate clumps for each density
and season combination.

# Read in the data

```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
quinn = read_csv('../data/quinn.csv', trim_ws=TRUE)
glimpse(quinn)
summary(quinn)
```


	
# Exploratory data analysis
```{r}
## Make variables categorial

quinn<- quinn %>% mutate(SEASON = factor(SEASON), DENSITY = factor(DENSITY))

## Boxplots (combination of density and season) one with most levels put on x-axis to avoid using lots of colours

ggplot(quinn, aes(y=RECRUITS, x=SEASON, fill=DENSITY)) + geom_boxplot()

## could see a small problem with nmore variance (bigger boxes in higher laying samples)
## log scale

ggplot(quinn, aes(y=RECRUITS, x=SEASON, fill=DENSITY)) + geom_boxplot() + scale_y_log10()
## possoin moddel
```

Model formula:
$$
\begin{align}
y_i &\sim{} \mathcal{Pois}(\lambda_i)\\
ln(\mu_i) &= \boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i}\\[1em]
\end{align}
$$
                                           
where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of effects parameters and $\bf{X}$
is a model matrix representing the intercept and effects of season, density and their interaction on mussel recruitment.

# Fit the model
```{r}
## star means each of the terms plus interactions
quinn.glm1 <- glm(RECRUITS ~ DENSITY*SEASON, data=quinn, family=poisson(link='log'))
```

# Model validation
```{r}
autoplot(quinn.glm1, which=1:6)
```
# Model investigation / hypothesis testing
```{r}
1-pchisq(quinn.glm1$deviance, df=quinn.glm1$df.residual)
##2.457479e-12 evidence for lack of fit, could be driven by the outlier, 
## Check for dispersion
quinn.glm1$deviance/quinn.glm1$df.residual
##3.677366 means model is overdispersed, no good fit. But we know there were 0s in the data, lets explore how we might assess overdispersion, is there an excessive number of zeros. Lets count up number of zeros, what proportion of our data is zeros, then we compare that to how many we should expect to get. Ideally do that for every population, this example one population with zeros (Winter-low).

## two equals is a question, Total =n gives totals in rows,
quinn %>% group_by(SEASON, DENSITY) %>% summarise(Mean=mean(RECRUITS), Zeros = sum(RECRUITS==0), Total = n()) %>% mutate(Prop = Zeros/Total)
## 0 for 2 / 3 observations is very high
##How many zeros did we expect?

rpois(1, lambda=2.67)
x <- rpois(100000000, lambda=2.67)
tab.1= table(x==0)
tab.1/sum(tab.1)

##DHARMa will use standardized residuals to simulate your model and incorporate them as "noise", also good for auto-correlation (lack of independence).

simulateResiduals1 <- simulateResiduals(quinn.glm1, plot=TRUE)
# residuals scaled so centred around 0.5, red stars show residuals have maxed out,  outside of range of simulated data. Big flag for 0 inflation, do not expect as many 0s as we do. Here it fits three lines, one is in centre one around 25th quantile one around 75th quantile, its done because there might not be a straight pattern in your residuals. Data of low numbers of barnacles might operate in a linear matter but higher barnacle counts might not. We want to see that all of them are roughly linear, if we have 0 inflated the bottom one might be wiggly. 

testDispersion(quinn.glm1)

## Test for dispersion, how does our data relate to simulated values. It is way out of range, red line out of range

testZeroInflation(quinn.glm1)
## shows evidence for excessive 0s, red line out of range, we could address this by using a 0 inflated model. We expecte 0 zeros in a lot of populations, 1 in a few, but redline (actual 0s) for 2 is way more frequent than should be
## Could also use a negative binomial.

quinn.nb <- glm.nb(RECRUITS ~ DENSITY * SEASON, data=quinn)
autoplot(quinn.nb, which =1:6)
simulateResiduals <- simulateResiduals(quinn.nb, plot=TRUE)
## qq plot looks way better, and residuals only show one outlier. It is a more appropriate model
## If we did a goodness of fit test, shows slight no fit but test before is more robust

1-pchisq(quinn.nb$deviance, df=quinn.nb$df.residual)

quinn.nb$deviance/quinn.nb$df.residual

##graph DENSITY*SEASON PLOT, if the lines were parallel no interaction, if lines cross there is an interaction, would not put a graph like this into your paper but helps to interpret
plot(allEffects(quinn.nb), multiline=TRUE, ci.style='bar')
## put on link scale(log scale), so it will be on the same scale as our summary table
plot(allEffects(quinn.nb), multiline=TRUE, ci.style='bar', type='link')
summary(quinn.nb)

##intercept represents autumn high (alphabetical), often does not matter which is first group. So everything gets compared to intercept, so if intercept is estimated poorly everything is off. If you have a choice and if you have low replication in one category do not use that group as first/intercept. First line here is representing difference between autumn high and low in autumn. SEASONSpring is difference between autumn high and spring high, same for summer and winter, now for the interactions: You expect the gap between summer and autumn to be as autumn to autumn but it is much bigger which is significant, winter is not significant because it is more variable. There is evidence of an interaction which is driven by summer being different

plot(allEffects(quinn.nb), multiline=TRUE, ci.style='bar') ## to interpret this graph, we use tidy to change the values to the response scale

tidy(quinn.nb, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE) ## no the values are not plus minus but multiplication, on this scale if the conf.int does not cross 1 its significant

## lets do a pairwise comparison
emmeans(quinn.nb, pairwise ~ DENSITY| SEASON, type='response')

```
# Summary figures
```{r}
# lets make a figure
newdata <- emmeans(quinn.nb, ~DENSITY|SEASON, type='response') %>% as.data.frame()
head(newdata)

ggplot(newdata, aes(y=response, x=SEASON, fill=DENSITY)) + 
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin=asymp.LCL, ymax=asymp.UCL), shape=21, position = position_dodge(width=0.2)) +
  theme_classic() + annotate(geom ='text', x='Summer', y=70, label='*', size=7)
