# Scenario

An ecologist studying a rocky shore at Phillip Island, in southeastern Australia, was interested in how
clumps of intertidal mussels are maintained [@Quinn-1988-137]. In particular, he wanted to know how densities of adult
mussels affected recruitment of young individuals from the plankton. As with most marine invertebrates,
recruitment is highly patchy in time, so he expected to find seasonal variation, and the interaction
between season and density - whether effects of adult mussel density vary across seasons - was the aspect
of most interest.

The data were collected from four seasons, and with two densities of adult mussels. The experiment
consisted of clumps of adult mussels attached to the rocks. These clumps were then brought back to the
laboratory, and the number of baby mussels recorded. There were 3-6 replicate clumps for each density
and season combination.

# Read in the data

```{r readData, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
quinn = read_csv('../data/quinn.csv', trim_ws=TRUE)
glimpse(quinn)
summary(quinn)
```


	
# Exploratory data analysis
```{r}
## Make variables categorial

quinn<- quinn %>% mutate(SEASON = factor(SEASON), DENSITY = factor(DENSITY))

## Boxplots (combination of density and season) one with most levels put on x-axis to avoid using lots of colours

ggplot(quinn, aes(y=RECRUITS, x=SEASON, fill=DENSITY)) + geom_boxplot()

## could see a small problem with nmore variance (bigger boxes in higher laying samples)
## log scale

ggplot(quinn, aes(y=RECRUITS, x=SEASON, fill=DENSITY)) + geom_boxplot() + scale_y_log10()
## possoin moddel
```

Model formula:
$$
\begin{align}
y_i &\sim{} \mathcal{Pois}(\lambda_i)\\
ln(\mu_i) &= \boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i}\\[1em]
\end{align}
$$
                                           
where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of effects parameters and $\bf{X}$
is a model matrix representing the intercept and effects of season, density and their interaction on mussel recruitment.

# Fit the model
```{r}
## star means each of the terms plus interactions
quinn.glm1 <- glm(RECRUITS ~ DENSITY*SEASON, data=quinn, family=poisson(link='log'))
```

# Model validation
```{r}
autoplot(quinn.glm1, which=1:6)
```
# Model investigation / hypothesis testing
```{r}
1-pchisq(quinn.glm1$deviance, df=quinn.glm1$df.residual)
##2.457479e-12 evidence for lack of fit, could be driven by the outlier, 
## Check for dispersion
quinn.glm1$deviance/quinn.glm1$df.residual
##3.677366 means model is overdispersed, no good fit. But we know there were 0s in the data, lets explore how we might assess overdispersion, is there an excessive number of zeros. Lets count up number of zeros, what proportion of our data is zeros, then we compare that to how many we should expect to get. Ideally do that for every population, this example one population with zeros (Winter-low).

## two equals is a question, Total =n gives totals in rows,
quinn %>% group_by(SEASON, DENSITY) %>% summarise(Mean=mean(RECRUITS), Zeros = sum(RECRUITS==0), Total = n()) %>% mutate(Prop = Zeros/Total)
## 0 for 2 / 3 observations is very high
##How many zeros did we expect?

rpois(1, lambda=2.67)
x <- rpois(100000000, lambda=2.67)
tab.1= table(x==0)
tab.1/sum(tab.1)
